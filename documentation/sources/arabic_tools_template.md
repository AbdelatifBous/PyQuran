## Alphabets
We use [PyArabic](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyArabic/0.6.2) constants which
represents letters, instead of writting Arabic in the code.

## Alphabetical Systems (Definitions)
[**Rasm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasm): is any set of letters which are
writtern in the same form, namely; they are indistinguishable in wirtting by
they are distinguished from the context. For example, the letters  ت ث ن ى,
they can be written with only one rasm ىـ, without dots.

**Alphabetical System**: is a set of rasm; dynamically constructed by 
specifying the letters that you will treat them as one rasm. By the way,  the
default Arabic alphabet is a special case of the **Alphabetical System** where
each letter is as one rasm.


**Predefined systems** are stored in `systems` object.

1. **Default**: each letter is treated as a unique rasm.
2. **Without Dots**: by removing the dots some letters will be
    indistinguishable; those letters are treated as one rasm.
    The following example shows the (Without Dots) system as a list of lists;
    where the sublist contains the letters which share the same rasm.
3. **Hamazat**: consider each any letter accompanied by hamaz ء as one rasm.

**NOTE**: You may go further and construct your system by speicying what 
letters you want to treat as one rasm, then you can do some statistical
analysis like, count, variance, average, ...

Example:
```python
q.systems.withoutDots
Out: 
[['ب', 'ت', 'ث', 'ن'], # Rasm 1
 ['ح', 'خ', 'ج'], # Rasm 2
 ['د', 'ذ'], # Rasm 3
 ['ر', 'ز'], # Rasm 4
 ['س', 'ش'], # Rasm 5
 ['ص', 'ض'], # Rasm 6
 ['ط', 'ظ'], # Rasm 7
 ['ع', 'غ'], # Rasm 8
 ['ف', 'ق']] # Rasm 9
```


### Constructing a user-defined system:
```python
system = [[alef_hamza_above, alef],
          [beh, teh]]
```
The previous piece of code means "Treat *alef_hamza_above* and *alef*
as the same one latter, also treat *beh* and *teh* as one letter as well".

The rest of letters can be dynamically constructed using `check_system()`

And then, a system can be applied to some text analysis functions like counting,
filtering, etc.
