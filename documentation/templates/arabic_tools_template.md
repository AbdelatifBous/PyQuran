## Alphabets
We use [PyArabic](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyArabic/0.6.2) constants which
represents letters, instead of writting Arabic in the code.

## Alphabetical Systems
We define **alphabetical system** as a dynamic construction of letters in which
you can treat a group of letters one letter. The default alphabet is a special
case of the Alphabetical System where each letter is treated as one letter.

**Predefined systems** are stored in `systems` object.

1. default.
2. without dots system.
3. hamazat.

Example:
```python
q.systems.withoutDots
Out: 
[['ب', 'ت', 'ث', 'ن'],
 ['ح', 'خ', 'ج'],
 ['د', 'ذ'],
 ['ر', 'ز'],
 ['س', 'ش'],
 ['ص', 'ض'],
 ['ط', 'ظ'],
 ['ع', 'غ'],
 ['ف', 'ق']]
```


**Constructing a user-defined system**:
```python
system = [[alef_hamza_above, alef],[beh, teh]]
```
The previous line of code means "Treat *alef_hamza_above* and *alef*
as the same one latter, also treat *beh* and *teh* as one letter as well"

And then, a system can be applied to some text analysis functions like counting,
filtering, etc.
