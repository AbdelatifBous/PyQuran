## Quran Arabic Corpus

We use **[tanzil](http://tanzil.net/docs/download) Quran Corpus**, (*Uthmanic Version*).
* Text format is `UTF-8`


## NOTE:
If you are going to run on `Emacs` shell. It *MUST* be configured to use `UTF-8`;
<br /> else you see this
```python
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1: ordinal not in range(128)
```
to avoid *emacs configuration* headache, use a terminal that supports `UTF-8` to run the code =]
