# Define the `ParseSura` function that takes the n^th Sura and a list of alphabets that contains m unicodes representing m characters; the default is the 29 characters (complete the initialization of the defulat value), where hamza is the 29th letter. The function parses the Sura and returns axm ndarray, A, where a is the number of verses and A[i,j] is the number of occurences of the letter alphabets[j] in verse i.

def ParseSura(n, alphabets=['ا', 'ب']):
    A 
    return
